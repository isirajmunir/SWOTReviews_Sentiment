But we did not have cash Due to which it was very difficult to order a food. \nAfter a long time struggle, we thought of ordering food from food panda to paying money online, but we were told that food panda didn\'t accept debit card. We tried to order through the restaurant\'s official website," but we failed.\nThen we went to the Pizza-hut official website because we were tired of giving detail so we decided to chat with customer care department agent. That was this way\n""""sir do you accept debit card\nagent : yes we do\nWe are very happy to hear this and we went back to the website for ordering a food\nAfter selecting the order and then giving a debit card details when we click on Proceed order so we find that our """"nearest branch is closed""""\nAgain with the retribution"," we talked to some of the agents on chat\n""""sir we are dam hungry but unfortunately our nearest branch is closed and we didn\'t have a cash and we want to pay through our dabit card""""\nagent : sir can I arrange a call for you.\nwe : yeah.\nAnd then call from Pizza Hut\'s other branch \nThey said that you can place your order here Because we did not have any cash at that time so we reminded them"," then they told us that they would specially arrange you card swipe machine which you can pay for your payment.

"6	pizza hut	20	-	"" Pizza hut should be closed as it is unable to serve its customers. Today i visited pizza hut university road branch. The chillers werent working at all which can be felt right after entering the restaurant. Then the table we got was unbalanced and constantly moving. The floor of whole resturant was so dirty and oily that i was about to slip twice. The lights were broken. The overall furniture was in throw away condition.\n\nThe food was served after an hour of order. The server gave the explaination that """"sorry madam wrong temperature ki wja se apka food jal gya tha dobara banaya hai"""". The cutlery was in pathetic condition. We were 4 on the table and the cutlery was insufficient which was served after reminding atleast 4 times. The pasta served was not upto the mark and tasteless. Also it was served without garlic bread and upon asking the waiter"," he said """"hum ne discontinue krdia hai garlic bread dena lekin mai apko serve krwa deta hun complimentary"""" as if he was giving us the favour and as if i dont know that he forgot to serve. Last but not the least", when i paid the bill and it was supposed to be charged at 50% rate due to discount on alfalah card, he deducted about 100 Rs extra and after arguing, returned me the over charged amount in cash.\n\nOverall it was the worst experience and while sitting at pizza hut," i was feeling like sitting on some road side dhaaba. The ambiance was literally 0/10. Will never go again\n#saynotopizzahut'"""

Guests and waiters were crowded every where on the ground floor. I noticed staff from the boatbasin branch as well. We were finally seated on the 1st floor .  \nI have no complaint against the food , infact the quality and frehness has improved alot, so, 8/10  for  food. Sadly, for a dine in facility, this is not the only thing that matters. Two of the most important things that matter are cleanliness and service , on which I will give pizza hut a 2/10.  \nThere were zero buses,one server , one manager, and one cashier to be seen on the floor and number of heads on that floor were 30 plus .The service was a complete disaster. The table alloted to us was not cleared  and the floors were filthy. Order was processed within 15 minutes, but drinks, ketchup, and napkins were delivered much after we were done with our meal. Even crockery and cutlery was delivered after several calls to the waiter. Throughout the dinner i think i personally left the table 5 times to call the waiter. We complained twice to two different guys who were both suposedly managers. And the tables around us were also continously complaining.When there were a lot of complaints, the general manger went to his office and I did not see him until we were leaving.\nA very sorry experience for my family at one of the first few franchises of Pakistan," hope my next visit will be much better than this.'"""

"10	pizza hut	20	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERADIL\nEatery: Vintage \xe2\x80\x93 On The Go\nDate: 13th Dec", 2017\n\nVintage OTG is not really a new name to the Foodies. Vintage OTG recently launched their new outlet in Gulshan, Block 4. I went there with a couple of friends to check how they are serving with their signature food. This is how it went:\n\nThe restaurant is located near Disco Bakery, exactly opposite to Pizza Hut in Gulshan, Block 4. This area is quickly developing into yet another food street with some really good eateries on the list. Vintage is another good addition to the list. The location is accessible from most parts of the city. This is a small restaurant with seating arrangement of about 15 people. The dining area is well lit and elegantly decorated. They do not have parking space or valet service; the parking is at owner's risk. Luckily you can usually find a parking spot just in front or nearby. The staff is courteous and humble. Vintage on the Go has the basic theme of 'take away', so they don't have put any effort in presenting their food. However, they are kept the whole environment pretty neat and clean. \n1. Location: 3.5/5\n2. Ambiance: 3.5/5\n3. Service: 4/5\n4. Presentation: 2/5\n5. Hygiene: 3.5/5\n\nWe tried Parmesan Chicken, Spicy Southwestern Chicken, Spicy Alfredo Pasta and Spicy Chicken Burger and Lava Cake. The food tasted good; however, the pick of the menu for us was the Spicy Alfredo Pasta. Spicy Chicken Burger was not spicy; but they have added a crispy and crunchy coating to the chicken patty, which made it bite-worthy. I would love a juicier version of this burger. Parmesan Chicken and Spicy Southwestern Chicken - both were served with rice and tasted above average. Perhaps they should reduce the proportion of rice in each. The quantity of all the food items was sufficient and the price is reasonable. They have limited and selected items on menu; but the items they have on list are easy to carry on the go and that is the theme of this eatery.\n6. Taste: 6.5/10\n7. Quality: 7/10\n8. Quantity: 8/10\n9. Price: 8/10\n10. Menu Selection: 8/10\n\nFinal Words: With Vintage - On The Go," you will get quality food on the go!\n#VintageOTGgulshan #ParmesanChicken #SouthwesternChicken #SpicyAlfredoPasta #SpicyChicenBurger #LavaCake\n\nPS: The food was actually better than the pictures."""""""
"11	pizza hut	20	-	"" Eighty20\n\nAmongst the dozens of local fastfood options in Gulistan-e-Jauhar that offer the usual range of items like Zingers (and the many variants of the name)", broasts, pizzas and the street-Chinese, I visited this small little place (location: between Perfume Chowk and Jauhar Chowrangi), looking forward to be disappointed yet again by a self-proclaimed-Zinger burger, but what happened next was something I absolutely didn\'t expect. By the way, this was my first visit on the suggestion of a fellow FFI-member (he met the owner of this place somewhere else and he insisted on his giving his joint a try), so I obliged.\n\nFirstly, the prices are ridiculously cheap at this place, and yes, I too was concerned about the quality of food that would be served at such low price. The person on the counter was educated, and he was more than just courteous and helpful in picking out the deal for me, as well as the flavors to choose. For 1 person, he suggested a deal which had a Zinger and a small pizza, and both of these for Rs.250 only. Their strategy, as evident from the entire menu, is to keep the prices as low as possible, to make them a stand-out. There was another deal which offered 2 Zingers for Rs.200 only, so you people now get the idea.\n\nZinger:\nThe Zinger itself was decent. Wait. It was great, for the price it was being offered at. The chicken was moist, soft and succulent even to the last bite. The crispy batter outside was crispy," NOT hard. The frying of the chicken was done brilliantly; the color was a proper """"golden brown"""". The only set-backs for their Zinger was the meh!-mayonnaise they used. Keep that out of the burger and it was nicely done otherwise", without a doubt. The fries provided with the burger were bad though; refried, soggy, full of oil.\n\nPizza:\nThe person taking my order asked me whether I was looking for spicy, or a mild flavor. In short," he was doing more than just """"taking my order""""", as I\'m accustomed to from such fastfood joints. The flavor of choice was Chicken Fajita, and yet again, before taking a bite into the pizza, I was expecting it to be some okay-ish pizza, but I was proved absolutely wrong. The pizza was surprisingly full of flavors, toppings, with the cheese being properly stringy and nicely done, the crust very light. The pizza indeed reminded me of what Pizza Hut used to be like in its glory days.\nSafe to say, I will definitely be going again, to check their consistency. And well, to enjoy the pleasures of living in Karachi: good quantity, good tasting food," for as low as Rs.250.\n\nRabeet Rao.\nFFI.'"""

"39	espresso	25	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERHAMZA \n\nEatery: @Locokhi \n\nA fine place that has created its niche in the food industry. Located on the corner of Khe \xe2\x80\x93 Muslim Lane 11", this tapas bar and restaurant is going to create a legacy of its own. A small corner shop, hardly able to accommodate 30 people at max., has had people pouring in and making reservations since the day it opened. And after a long wait, the day finally came when I visited this place. It was a magical experience. They have three timings for reservation \xe2\x80\x93 7pm to 8:30pm, 8:30pm to 10pm and then 10pm onwards. I'll give the ratings below, for those who want a detailed review then read further:\n\nFood taste and quality: 9/10 \nAmbience: 7/10\nLocation: 7.5/10 \nService: 8.5/10 (I kid you not, 15 minutes and all your food is on the table)\nQuantity: 7/10 \nPrice: 7/10\n\nThe dishes that we ordered were the following: Ahi tuna poke and mango salad, Shrimp and cheese croquettes with aioli, stuffed mushroom caps, Japanese inspired snapper ceviche with wasabi, beef tacos, Pizza with Argentinian bresaola and rocket, Limon mojito, and Lomo asado. \n\nAhi tuna poke was a sliced out raw tuna fish served with iceberg, lettuce, mango slices, avocado and dressed in wasabi. I must admit, the wasabi had an amazing hit to it while just taking the first bite. We had to close our eyes and hold our noses because of how strong a hit it had \xe2\x80\x93 one of a kind experience. For salad lovers, this is a must try. \n\nMy favorite starter was the shrimp and cheese croquettes with aioli (mayonnaise seasoned with garlic). A very basic deep-fried croquette that was stuffed with cheese and small pieces of shrimps. Dip them in aioli and you have yourself a kid inside you jumping up and down at how delicious it was. \n\nTo be honest, not the biggest fan of snapper ceviche dressed in wasabi \xe2\x80\x93 but to all those who do love ceviche, my friend says it is the best one he's had here in Karachi. So it is a good option for you if you're looking for some. \n\nThe stuffed mushroom caps were basically tiny pieces of 5 mushrooms stuffed with delicious spinach and cheese that would enter your palate and would burst with flavor! An incredible dish. Very tiny in portion, no doubt, but a dish worth ordering. \n\nThe beef tacos were dry, although had a variety of seasoning served with it and was basically a DIY kind of a deal. Not much of a fan there as well. The pizza on the other hand, wow! Bresaola is air-dried, salted beef that has been aged two or three months until it becomes hard and turns a dark red, almost purple color. A very fine thin crust pizza topped with rocket and bresaola and so much cheese. Oh the cheese. One of the finest recommended dishes at loco is this pizza. \n\nLastly the lomo asado \xe2\x80\x93 sliced tenderloin served with chimichurri and Brazilian vinaigrette. Tenderloin is one of the most expensive meat cuts in the market and they did a very nice medium on it. The perfect texture of a medium done steak that you need, dressed in chimichurri which is made of parsley, garlic, vinegar, olive oil, and flakes of chili pepper and a Brazilian vinaigrette. \n\nAs for the drinks \xe2\x80\x93 their espresso shot is at par with Arbor (meaning extremely good), and the limon mojito and cucumber with jalapeno smoothie is worth trying out. I'll leave you to judge these drinks on your own. Trust my word, so refreshing. \n\nIt was unfortunate that they didn't have churros that day, because I was really looking forward to trying those. But nonetheless, this restaurant is outstanding. It appeals to a certain crowd, with a certain palate, and for those wanting to explore their taste buds \xe2\x80\x93 like myself. It is an expensive place, for four people and those dishes mentioned we were charged roughly around PKR 2100/- per head without ordering dessert. But this place is worth an experience. At least once. Do give it a try on your next dinner outing! And make sure you have a reservation there before you go," or else it'll be hard to find a seat. \n\nWishing loco and its staff the best!"""""""

The French Press has a special place in my heart, though. That I can use, basically because I have 3 courtesy of my amazing Taiabu (Paternal uncle) and it was he who introduced me to the world of ground coffee.\n\nI didn't think I would ever find coffee grounds the likes of the German brand, Jacobs Kronug in Karachi. That's why I was so happy to find Fika Coffee Co. has recently been introduced by Fahad Arif Moten, an avid coffee connoisseur, definitely more so than my instant junkie self. As you can see, he has done the packaging right, by adding a vacuum seal to ensure maximum freshness of the coffee grounds. It's also resealable so you can keep the product in the packaging until the last tablespoon. Not to mention, all their coffee is certified specialty grade, which means on the SCAA grading scale, every bean has a cupping score of at least 78 or higher. Fancy? I know!\n\nI have attached the product list Fahad sent over, and I chose Celebration Day because it was perfect for espresso purposes. You can choose either the coffee bean or the ground variety. Priced at PKR 600 for 100 g and PKR 1100 for 250 g, there is also a subscription box available for PKR 2000 with special blend coffees for the true coffee lover.\n\nWas the coffee worth it? Absofrickinlutely. If you're getting the ground coffee, a French Press is definitely the way to go. The Celebration Day blend was strong, smooth," and had a definite zing of instant energy."""""""

"117	the burger shack	44	-	"" Visited Vintage OTG at LuckyOne Mall", for the first time, just for Spicy Alfredo Pasta's Combo, as I saw many positive reviews for it, so couldn't control. But sadly, they made us wait for like an hour (actually they took more than that) because they were not taking orders (for the reason I don't know but yes they were open) so to kill the hunger, we had to order something else from other eateries there at the food court.\nOrdered these:\n* Beef Chilli Dry with Fried Rice from China Grill. 9/10 Beef was well cooked. Fried Rice were okay. Not so good, not so bad.\n* Regular Chicken Tikka Pizza from California Pizza 10/10 Their pizzas are to die for, LITERALLY!! Have visited them time and again and never ever had a single bad experience. This is the main reason I'm so reluctant to try other pizza restaurants.\n* Chicken Burger (don't remember its name) from The Burger Shack 7/10 My lil' cousin (who was the birthday boy) didn't like it much. It wasn't juicy and spicy enough for which he was craving but yes, fries were too good!\n* Biryani 9/10 and Haleem 3/10 from Chachajees. Biryani's serving size was great and it was tasty (wasn't expecting it though) Whereas Haleem was distasteful and unappetizing. I regret wasting my money on it. WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT.\nThen, after cutting the cake and eating McDonald's icecreams and roaming around, went again to OTG to see if they are taking orders but AGAIN they asked us to wait for another half an hour. Because my cousin wanted to taste it once because of all the hype, we waited for another hour. Then finally had the privilege to try it. I would rate it 9/10. Though pasta and hot shots were served hot and serving size was great but the very sharp taste of black pepper making the sauce brackish. Plus the amount of chicken in the pasta kind of disappointing, didn't match with the amount of pasta and sauce in it.\nAnyway, since the birthday boy liked it so I didn't comment much. Though their sauce lacked one special spice Sizzlers' use in their Alfredo Pasta. But nevermind.\n\nPS: We were so hungry so we couldn't take pictures of what we ate before OTG.

On reaching the location i did a rain check to confirm it was not invaded by #KEF disqualified lot \xf0\x9f\x98\x89\xf0\x9f\x98\x89 luckily it was about 40% empty, the staff was very gracious and arranged a table at lightening speed which is commendable, Abdullah our server was extremely energetic and really delivered on all counts. We ordered the mixed platter and the new Chicken platter, a refreshing lime drink was also served which was excellent. Fresh bread was served when we arrived and as soon as that finished it was immediately replenished with piping hot bread. Along with mixed grill platter we were served complimentary hummus and french fries, both were fresh and tasty, only thing missing was olives.\nParamount is originally based in missisaga Canada while Karachi is a franchise location. \nIt was brilliant to have authentic arabic food in Karachi after ages, even Kababish at movenpick has lots its touch. Definitely i would give Paramount a 9 out of 10 and duly recommend it for arabic food lovers.

"164	paramount	68	-	"" Favorites from Paramount Fine Foods PK - this was my second time to Paramount and I must say I was happy with the food", freshness of the food & authentic taste. The best part about this place is the fresh & hot pita they serve as soon as you are seated. It's on the house, and they keep checking if it's still hot or finished, that's when they replace the cold one with a hot one. Tried with Olive oil and the garlic sauce & it was yum. My favorites from this place are:\n1. Yalla Fries - These are the best fries topped with grilled chicken & sauce I have tried so far (not comparing it to thailay wale fries). The chicken was full of flavor, hence bite of all mixed together was heavenly.\n2. Saj Wrap - A lebanese flat bread filled with potato fries & grilled chicken, served with fries and pickled veggies. The wrap itself is grilled which makes the covering a little crisp. It isn't dry neither it has too much going on with sauces & flavors inside. You can clean the palate with the pickled veggies.\n3. Falafel with Tahini Sauce - Something I can associate with what I had in Makkah. The flavor is exactly the same. Everything was balanced in terms of flavors and cooking.\n4. Fattoush Salad - This may not be the best for many, but I enjoyed every bite of it. It was fresh," balanced seasoning and dressing. I can eat salads like these every day :D\n5. ABC juice - This was a perfect combo to go with all the middle eastern food I was having. \n\nThese are my favorites out of the things I tried."""""""

Place is double the size of Xander's Bukhari Commercial but seating arrangement is half of it. Waiting time of the guests can easily be reduced by fixing the layout and making it more practical.  Now coming to the food- Steak. Ordered medium-well but it was certainly not medium-well. It was under done. Chewy and not juicy. They dont have an option of mashed potatoes with steak which was again a disappointment for me. Had to wait for good 10 mins for the server to pour cheese on it so we can start our meal. Staff is not trained properly and was panicking for no obvious reason. In the middle of our meal we realized a group of kids standing on our heads waiting for our table to get free"," had to call the staff and asked them to usher the kids to the waiting area so we can enjoy our meal in peace.

"291	broadway pizza	116	-	"" Ok so here goes out my review to the pizza outlet saying """" Every bite is a performance """" ", Well... they really need to change this slogan as this could be fit only for their pizza \'s category and not for the menu they have been catering Broadway Pizza \nToday while in office,  i ordered online (20% off on all orders)  looking at their scrumptious descriptions of menu,  i decided to go for the KNOCKOUT TRIO - SOUTHWESTERN (Oven baked sandwich)  of Rs.  350 and one of their BBQ ranch Pasta , which was of Rs.  319 \nWell.  Extremely disappointed at the very first bite of their recently launched knockout oven baked sandwich (SOUTHWESTERN FLAVOR) , the sandwich claims to have Mozarella cheese which was missing and was totally imbalance with respect to chicken chunks and veggies overflowing with pungent smelling mayonnaise and very mild taste of the bun!  Pasta was very mild and did not taste good. Jalapenos were missing outside and isnide as well.  I mean why do these restaurants write over description of what\'s inside while they can\'t provide. \nEven after addressing complain," their response was so cold and less bothered that I am seriously disappointed and would never recommend anyone to try these from Broadway.

"292	broadway pizza	116	-	"" #TSGBloggerHina\n\nIn Review: Broadway Pizza Oven Baked Sandwiches\n\nLet's admit", sandwiches and wraps are a bit messier to have for some people *hint, that's me*. But the best ones are those that require extra napkins! A hearty and filling sandwich is an absolute comfort food for me and I can have it wherever I am *I am a non conformist who doesn't follow any special societal rules* . Recently, I happened to try this new oven baked sandwich by Broadway Pizza which is a take on American southern style sandwiches. Sharing a quick review here.\n\nFlavors I tried:\nHot Buffalo\nThe filling comprised of chicken fajita, cucumber, pineapple, jalapeno, iceberg, tomato, mozzarella cheese, and spicy buffalo sauce. It was obviously spicier for my taste and also the chunks of pineapples coupled with jalapeno and buffalo sauce turned the flavor a bit peculiar. But if you want to have a kick of some interesting flavors going around at the same time, you'd like to try it!\n\nSouth Western\nIt has a really well balanced flavor comprised of chicken tikka chunks, garlic ranch sauce,cucumber, onions, iceberg, green peppers, jalapeno, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Sandwiches overloaded with onions is always a good news for me so that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it better than Hot Buffalo. Mozzarella cheese was more generously spread here as compared to the hot buffalo flavor. \n\nBut the chunks of chicken were fairly juicy on both the sandwiches with a good meat-to-bun ratio. Also, jalapeno added a moderate sour bite and watery crunch in both flavors exciting for the taste buds. \n \nThe bun was soft, thick and not too oily but I think a little crust could have really made it more delicious. Garlic and barbecue dips were served with the sandwiches. \n\nServing Size\nThe neatly packaged sandwiches appeared quite fulfilling and I thought they should be enough for 2 people, only it was three of us who ended up chomping them down without any sighing over the serving size. Worked as an evening snack for us, but this should be quite satisfying for a person as a sizeable meal.\n\nPrice\nThe sandwich deal *with a drink* is priced at Rs. 349 which is a solid value if you look at the filling portion. \n\nWhile I am not sure if Broadway will keep these sandwiches around as mains," I do believe it's worth sampling at least once! Dig in!\n\nPackaging 7.5/10\nQuality 7.5/10\nQuanity 8.5/10\nTaste 7.5/10\nPrice: 8/10"""""""

The moment I stepped out of my car," I spotted a few boys dropping brochures of a burger joint in my alley. One of them approached me and handed over 2 of those to me. I courteously accepted and thanked him. I reviewed the very nicely and neatly designed brochure of """"Beezer Bytz"""" \xe2\x80\x93 The burger taken care by the make-up accessories (kinda unique idea \xe2\x80\x93 at least to me). Being a foodie and a burger lover", I ordered 2 burgers from Beezer Bytz (Beezer Beef and BBQ Mushrooom). The order was delivered in just 25 minutes or perhaps lesser. \n\nBurger is not a gentleman\'s thing to eat i.e. with sophistication and cleanliness, the messier it gets the better it is; this is exactly what I experienced with Beezer Beef and BBQ Mushroom. The Beezer Beef is for real beef lovers. It is one loaded burger which will satiate your divine starvation. I simply loved Beezer Beef, no second thoughts on that. \nBBQ Mushroom was stuffed with mushrooms and BBQ sauce, as it is visible in the picture above. The moist and juicy beefy patty took it to another level. The burger tasted amazingly well made. The name BBQ Mushroom, simply delivers what it promises with its name. \n\nThen on, Tuesday 22nd March, I dialed the Beezer Bytz number and ordered for chicken range burgers to see if they offer as scrumptious burgers in chicken too. I ordered Flamy Chicken burger, Beezer Chicken, Crunchy chicken Burger and Classic Beef burger.\n\nThe Beezer Chicken is the perfect answer to one of very mighty and famous burgers in the market (won\'t name it though). It is highly cost friendly but this doesn\'t mean that the taste is any lesser or compromised based on the lesser price. I think I might order Beezer Chicken from now on, to satisfy my mighty hunger for chicken burgers.\n\nCrunchy chicken burger is okay. It is one of those burgers which are always the safest bet. This particular burger will mostly be liked by kids and students with a tad limited budget to spend over food. \n\nFlamy Chicken burger is hot again. Lots of Jalapenos," hot sauce and cheese that\'s with tender chicken fillet covered with crispiness \xe2\x80\x93 isn\'t it appetizing?  \n\nBeezer Burger offers some great burgers with very affordable prices.

"326	tao	128	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERHAMZA \n\nEatery: TAO - Pan Asian Cuisine \n\nTAO has recently upped their menu by bringing in some delightful", niche items for all the food lovers to try out! The following were ordered from their newly drafted menu: From sushi; dragon maki and salmon avocado maki. From the Dim Sum menu: Szechuan steamed wontons, Har Gow (light steamed chicken dumplings), Gyoza (pan seared Japanese dumplings) and Sui Mai (open faced dumplings topped with caviar). The main course ordered was a Thai steamed salmon and yellow curry prawns. \n\nVerdict: If you're looking for something crazy to try out, this should be your go to place! \n\nTAO for myself and my family has always been a safe bet for pan Asian cuisine. And now recently while bringing out their new menu, they have experimented into a new area of untapped potential in our food industry. \n\nOverall ratings: \n\nTaste: 7/10\n\nQuality: 8/10\n\nQuantity: 7/10\n\nPresentation: 9/10\n\nService: 7/10\n\nHygiene: 9/10\n\nWhen you talk about authenticity; TAO has gone out of their way to make sure they bring in real flavors of Asia. The sushi was top notch, with probably the finest ingredients available in the market. Tao generally has been a good place for sushi. The dim sums were a new thing for me in Karachi, and after having them at Tao, I'm hoping this trend would continue and grow amongst other eateries as well. The sauces they used, the wontons and dumplings they made were on the mark. Spicy just where you needed it to be and served steamy hot on your table. My favorite one that topped the charts was the Thai steamed salmon. I'm a huge seafood fan as it is, and what an amazingly pink, soft, floating in a perfectly balanced gravy this course was served. Very fulfilling on the stomach and a delight for the palate. \n\nWhat impressed me most was their presentation. They served exactly what they've mentioned on their menu \xe2\x80\x93 and you can google to cross check. \n\nAn excellent initiative taken up by TAO. So, if you're looking to experiment your Asian palate," head on out!"""""""

The mixed meat Teppanyaki had a combination of chicken and beef. The beef was cooked perfectly the chicken too was quite succulent.

You can pick it up from her house or get it delivered. But they were seriously yummy! \nAnd everything was made at home including the spice mixture so it was very clean and good. And it was almost a kilo of potato-ee goodness for like 350rs. Will definitely order again cause pait barr gaya but dil nahi xD'
"367	spice	135	-	"" Visited Vintage OTG at LuckyOne Mall", for the first time, just for Spicy Alfredo Pasta's Combo, as I saw many positive reviews for it, so couldn't control. But sadly, they made us wait for like an hour (actually they took more than that) because they were not taking orders (for the reason I don't know but yes they were open) so to kill the hunger, we had to order something else from other eateries there at the food court.\nOrdered these:\n* Beef Chilli Dry with Fried Rice from China Grill. 9/10 Beef was well cooked. Fried Rice were okay. Not so good, not so bad.\n* Regular Chicken Tikka Pizza from California Pizza 10/10 Their pizzas are to die for, LITERALLY!! Have visited them time and again and never ever had a single bad experience. This is the main reason I'm so reluctant to try other pizza restaurants.\n* Chicken Burger (don't remember its name) from The Burger Shack 7/10 My lil' cousin (who was the birthday boy) didn't like it much. It wasn't juicy and spicy enough for which he was craving but yes, fries were too good!\n* Biryani 9/10 and Haleem 3/10 from Chachajees. Biryani's serving size was great and it was tasty (wasn't expecting it though) Whereas Haleem was distasteful and unappetizing. I regret wasting my money on it. WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT.\nThen, after cutting the cake and eating McDonald's icecreams and roaming around, went again to OTG to see if they are taking orders but AGAIN they asked us to wait for another half an hour. Because my cousin wanted to taste it once because of all the hype, we waited for another hour. Then finally had the privilege to try it. I would rate it 9/10. Though pasta and hot shots were served hot and serving size was great but the very sharp taste of black pepper making the sauce brackish. Plus the amount of chicken in the pasta kind of disappointing, didn't match with the amount of pasta and sauce in it.\nAnyway, since the birthday boy liked it so I didn't comment much. Though their sauce lacked one special spice Sizzlers' use in their Alfredo Pasta. But nevermind.\n\nPS: We were so hungry so we couldn't take pictures of what we ate before OTG. So," sorry! \xf0\x9f\x8c\x9d"""""""

"369	spice	135	-	"" #TSGINTERNSHENEIR\n\nEatery: MEWS\n\nVerdict: Scrumptious food", good location, and a beautiful ambiance with a decent/fancy crowd!\n\nAll about the order: Sunday's call for a nice lunch out with your favorite people, and Mews seemed like the perfect place to go for some comfort food after a long week. The 4 of us ordered: Mac N Cheese, Scrambled Eggs with Pepperoni, the Mews Club Sandwich and their Margherita Plank Pizza (which we got chicken added to, because who can survive without meat?)\n\nRatings:\n\nTaste: 9/10\nQuality: 8.5/10\nQuantity: 7.5/10\nLocation: 7/10\nService: 7/10\nAmbiance: 8/10\nPresentation: 8.5/10\nValue for Money: 8.5/10\nPrice: 7.5/10\nTotal Bill: Rs. 4800/- (4 people including drinks and tax) - Rs. 1200/- per head\n\nThe analysis of the food: When it comes to eating out and spending thousands of rupees on food, taste, quality and hygiene play a huge factor. To start off with, I ordered the Mac N Cheese because I was craving some kind of pasta and I really just wanted any kind of comfort food at that point. What's better than Mac N Cheese? Definitely got me all nostalgic. Their Mac N Cheese was actually quite good. I'm so happy that it wasn't TOO CHEESY because too much cheese makes me sick. It was just the right amount. It wasn't bland, but I did add tobasco sauce to my dish for extra spice and flavor! - Rs. 749/-\n\nIf you're a major fan of pizza like I am, Mews has a good range of flatbread pizzas. We ordered their Margherita Plank Pizza but we wanted some meat, so we told them to add chunks of chicken on top! The pizza was juicy and flavorful. I generally like the pizzas at Mews. But, I've definitely had better pizzas in Karachi. - Rs. 700/-\n\nThe next thing we ordered was the Mews Club Sandwich. You really cannot go wrong with a Club Sandwich. It's the most basic meal you can get at any restaurant or cafe in Karachi. I have to say, Mews does serve up a good quantity when it comes to food, and their sandwiches did not lack taste or filling either. Being someone who LOVES sandwiches, I would definitely go back for seconds! - Rs. 825/-\n\nLastly, my friend wanted to order off their Breakfast menu (which they stop serving after 4PM). She ordered their Scrambled Eggs with Pepperoni which is served with fries on the side. Breakfast for lunch or dinner? WHY NOT? Breakfast meals are always the best - Eggs all the way! Although, this did lack a lot of Pepperoni cause you can literally count them on top. - Rs. 615/-\n\nSo I don't normally write 'amazing' reviews unless I really like a place and go there very often. So if you haven't been to Mews, you should definitely give it a go. It's got a very lively ambiance. I personally love going there to take a million pictures with my friends! The location isn't too bad either. I also really love the trendy and chic theme that Mews has going on with the blues and whites and how they match their plates as well. And last but not least," the main reason would be the really good FOOD!"""""""

Owner kept claiming that it's just the oyster and sesame oil. Anywho, I wasn't the only one. Saw two more people complaining. \n\n2) Wing It -Loaded fries are LIES. Absolutely terrible! Just don't. Only go for it if you like brown piyaaz, beans and half done fries. 200/- down the drain! \n\n3)Khousay 2.0-This is the first time I have ever tried commercial Khawsay.

"460	burger lab	163	-	"" Karachi Eat 2018 review from someone lucky enough to actually get inside \n\nSo I went before the opening time and didn't get to experience the horror everyone's been talking about. At that time there were no proper lines so I got in in like 10 mins. I agree it's a whole lot of nuisance since they've kept the entrance so that only one person can enter into the park at one time", not a very good strategy I believe! \n\nLet me save my judgment for the end and get on with the food we all tried (in order of execution and not ranking):\n\n1. Cafe Praha. Chimney cake with soft serve. We were probably one of the initial customers and so I gave my feedback on spot. I'd ask you all to give them a try and maybe you'd have a better experience. \n\n2. Canadian poutine from No lies fries. If you look at it as normal fries and shredded beef with some weird paneer looking cubes and extremely sparse gravy they weren't too bad. But definitely not poutine! And yes there was a 20 min line, so not worth it. \n\n3. Chapli kabab House. I personally believe that you should only try new eateries with interesting foods, but every year we make an exception for CKH's hot of the pan Chapli kababs with garam naan. So good. They never taste the same at their outlet. \n\n4. Tacocat. So to be honest I probably never have had authentic tacos apart from some amazing pulled beef tacos I had in Chicago. The chicken ones were loaded with chunky salsa-ish mixture with a ton of raw onions; which didn't leave a very pleasant after taste. Wouldn't recommend. The beef ones were decent but priced a little steep. Caution: extremely long lines!\n\n5. Fry guys. Tried chicken in waffle cone with honey mustard sriracha, this was probably the best and most innovative thing in KE18. Also tried the fried philly cheese steak sandwich which was essentially some pulled beef deep fried in a wonton/spring roll wrapper. It's probably a one time try thing. Caution: extremely long lines!\n\n6. 2 guys 1 grill. Donut burger. More burger less donut. I think the donut could've been a little more sweeter with that glaze to give you that contrast feel. It was a good juicy patty tho. Recommended. \n\n7. Poffterjjes. The name is confusing! Waffle burger. Good juicy burger. You gotta eat this quick, otherwise the sauces start to seep in the waffle make it soggy. Good price points. Value for money. \n\n8. BabaMoo. Candied Apple sandwich and jacket potato. The sandwich is multicoloured which in theory sounds nice but didn't really look very appetising. Taste wise was pretty meh too. Also had the opportunity to try their jacket potato which was genuinely very nice! Mine was cooked through and I notified the guys managing and they assured they'll look into it. So do give it a try (if you manage to get in)\n\n9. Grill in the city. Didn't have the time so went for their quicker option; corn dogs. These were standard frozen sausages deep fried NOT in corn batter and topped with some red mayo they call dynamite sauce. On their own they were decent deep fried and battered franks but you can't call them corn dogs. People did seem to enjoy their grilled prawns but till then didn't I have any time, energy nor the stomach capacity. These guys were doing very well in terms of traffic but didn't have queues so people were coming in from all directions.\n\n10. Hot bombz. In concept very good. In reality I would've liked more Mac n cheese and less fried mashed potato. \n\n11. Heyday. Standard soft serve icecream. Decent stuff. \n\n12. Wild fries. Cheeseburger fries. Exactly tasted like it sounds. Halloumi fries. Was expecting it to be a little soft but firm halloumi texture but couldn't find it. All I would say the taste of halloumi (which I love grilled with lemon and olive oil) was over powered with that sauce and them damned mint leaves. I really really wanted to like these! The steep price for these is justified since halloumi is not commonly available. \n \nFood wise a lot of safe play was observed apart from a couple of options. Gola ganda, fried prawns, burger lab to Banda kaheen bhi kha leta hai. I was expecting more innovation and more experiments. \n\nAll in all everybody inside seemed to have a very good time with dustbins strategically placed, ample place to sit (people actually brought in blankets to sit on and enjoy the food)," and a nicely done setup (although nothing could beat Frere hall)\n\nSpecial shout out to safeguard who had arranged a mobile hand wash station. The guy had a fertiliser-ish bag with a water nozzle and a utility belt with liquid soap and tissues. Perfect for those sauced up hands! \n\nAlso if you're planning on using Keenu it's ultimately your choice but most of the vendors were having connectivity issues so you end up trying to get rid of whatever money you have to whoever is accepting it."""""""

Launched on December 6, 2017; the burger has been adequately timed as winters are all about snuggling up in the blankets and enjoying comfort food.  \n\nThe Foodie's Perspective:\nI am a staunch believer that one should have beef whenever possible and nothing beats a combination of beef and cheese for comfort food; so the Quadra was a must try for the cheat meal\xe2\x80\xa6trust me it will turn your cheat day to a cheat meal\xe2\x80\xa6it's huge!\nAs you will notice below, the burger has a combination of multiple flavours including the tartness of Jalape\xc3\xb1os, the juiciness of the beef, the crunch of the onion rings, and the umami flavour of the mustard\xe2\x80\xa6overall all these ingredients combine to deliver an amazing flavour. Hence, I would say that this is definitely something beef lovers should try...but you need to have a big appetite to finish it because I only managed to finish 3/4 of it. \nComposition:\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Bun\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Mayonnaise\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Jalape\xc3\xb1os\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Onion Rings \n \xe2\x80\xa2 Pepperoni Slices\n \xe2\x80\xa2 4 Beef Patties With Yellow Cheddar Slices\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Mustard\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Iceberg Lettuce\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Ketchup\nFor those who have been having Burger Lab, would know that The Quadra is actually our all-time-favourite Big Bang with FOUR Beef Patties.  \n\nThe Marketing Perspective:\nThe key visual of the marketing campaign is based on enticing product shots on white background to ensure that the focus stays on the product only. The use of larger-than-life cut outs outside the shops helped attract the audience and create awareness. Besides that, extensive marketing on social media and reviews by various bloggers helped generate a positive buzz which induced trial\xe2\x80\xa6and that is exactly why I tried it!\nThe introductory price of the burger is Rs. 550; which is a reasonable one as the average fine dine main course costs the same. With the fries and drink combo the meal costs Rs. 680. The use of penetration pricing to induce trial is a smart move as the Pakistani market is not very keen on spending money on new products.\nA combination of black and white and an enticing product shot on the packaging ensures that the focus is on the product only. The packaging also displays the Quadra via icons and states the tagline: The Incredible 4ce which also depicts 4 patties. The font used for the logo has a style that flows freely," is friendly and organic; therefore the hand-painted text makes it look modern and handmade. \n\nRating:\nTaste: 9/10\nPackaging: 7/10 \nPrice: 8/10\nPromotion: 6/10\nValue for Money: 9/10\nTOTAL SCORE: 8/10\n\nVerdict: \nDefinitely the biggest burger in town\xe2\x80\xa6 overall a very good experience. Highly recommend it as I will have it again for sure!"""""""

I was happy about it but when I opened it up, I immediately knew something was wrong. \n\nThe chicken was brown, I mean very brown. When I tried it, I realized that chicken had gone bad. Buns were stale and It had an odd smell. However, the biggest surprise yet was that there was a pathetic amount of chicken in it, it was mostly just breading.\n\nJust looking at the burger I could tell it was made hours ago.

All I wanted to find out was whether or not I am capable of finishing what I was seeing but unfortunately I was trolled.\n \nBurger Lab promoted their newly launched Quadra as """"Pakistan\'s Biggest Burger"""" and by the time I was done with it for lunch", I was genuinely disappointed. Don\'t take me wrong here, the taste and quality of the burger were up to the par or at least what I was expecting out of Burger Lab; however," the quantity was most certainly not!\n\nLike seriously? You call that the biggest burger Pakistan has ever seen? I mean KFC\'s Mighty Zinger is bigger than your Quadra and what you are calling """"Pakistan\'s Biggest Burger"""" is Oh My Grill\'s  everyday job.\n\nNow", I don\'t mean to offend your efforts but promote what you can deliver. The Quadra I was served with was most certainly not as per the advertisements (Photos attached). When I saw that the Quadra was made up of 4 beef patties, I was expecting them to be at least a 100g patty if not 125g, however, upon inquiring, I got to know that the patties were 70g each and the meat in the burger itself was not more than 280g in total. Certainly not the biggest burger in Pakistan guys!\n\nFurthermore, later in the night, I saw Burger Lab uploading better versions of Quadra on their page straight from the kitchen but that was most certainly not what I was served with. Heck, I didn\'t even get my burger in the exclusive box for Quadra and it was simply wrapped up in a paper which frankly doesn\'t bother me much. But yes, these little things matter! \n\nYou can fool your customers as much as you want but it will not help you out in the long run. Every restaurant owner\'s nightmare \xe2\x80\x93 The Swot Team, would always be there to guide the foodies of Pakistan at all times.\n\nFinal Verdict : The taste or quality of the Quadra wasn\'t bad, however," I had higher expectations from """"Pakistan\'s Biggest Burger"""".\n\nOverall Rating : 4.8 / 10  \n\nFollow my food blog on Instagram and check out my love for food. #MunchingMerchant signing out!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/munching_merchant/'"""

"524	cosmopolitan	167	-	"" Best of 2017.  The year saw mushrooming of Pan Asian and Mandi places", mostly mediocre, with a few exceptions.  The following is a snapshot of whatever stood out during the year. \n\nLoco.  Fresh menu, fantastic flavors, and Frida Kahlo.  Yellow fin tuna tacos are the bomb.  And what's not to like about patata bravas, and those churros.  Credit cards being not accepted in 2017 CE is a bummer.  The world is moving towards crypto, the excuse for not accepting plastic is a dumb one.\n\nCote Rotie.  Continued to elevate flavor profiles.  New menu every time.  The ever faithful Steak Frites, Lamb Burger, Linguine,Shaquilles, and the Salted Caramel ice cream for the win.  Anchoring biases aside, Cote Rotie ought to be the best in the city\n\nCosmopolitan Gelato.  Creamy, and not icy.  Varied, and fantastic flavors.  Personal favorite being Chocolate Giraldu.  Less than 10% of imported content -- Cosmopolitan has developed a home grown product which is much better than the preservative heavy imported stuff.  Support local, shun imports.\n\nPita.  Solid Shawarma, and bowl.  Hopefully they can finally start serving Shawarma in pita as well, rather than saj.\n\nChop Chop Wok.  New locations, iterative additions to menu.  CCW continued to remain a safe bet.\n\nOkra. Old faithful.  Everything on the menu is a star.  Stick to lunch specials, and you're good without burning a hole in your pocket.\n\nEvergreen.  A fresh look at healthy, ensuring that healthy can also be tasty.  Prices have been jacked up though, so healthy is expensive as well.\n\nLush Crush.  Fantastic popsicles.  Think of a flavor, and they will have it.  Super flavors, which aren't calorie dense.  Cappuccino being a personal favorite.  The kid likes Oreo & Cream.\n\nTurkish Kebab House.  Solid food, in a shady area.  The super food makes up for it all.\n\nThere were a few misses as well, but let's not crib about those.  Special mention for suicide mission that Foodpanda is on.\n\nOverall -- 2017 saw innovation, and it saw people pushing the boundaries just a little bit more.  Here is to hoping that 2018 has people focusing more on food," and less on those fancy interiors."""""""

A large, bright yellow logo with an attractive bold font that catches the eye instantly. \n\nA group of 3 food mongers ordered what seemed to be the best on their menu: Smoked BBQ Beef and Bacon Burger, The Bistrovia Beef Burger (both burgers served with an extra patty), and Chicken Alfredo Pasta. \n\nOverall ratings: \n\nTaste: 8/10\n\nQuality: 8/10\n\nQuantity: 8.5/10\n\nAmbiance: 7/10\n\nLocation: 7/10\n\nHygiene: 8.5/10\n\nValue for Money: 9/10\n\nCost: Roughly PKR 550/- per head (including extra patty and a drink!)\n\nStarting off with the burgers \xe2\x80\x93 Smoked BBQ Beef and Bacon Burger: PLEASE BEFORE YOU JUMP YOUR SEATS, Bacon is not pork it is simply a specific type of meat cut prepared on a grill. No one in Pakistan serves Pork Bacon. This was halal, cow meat. Anyway, as you can probably see from the pictures, the double patty burger is monstrosity at its best. 120-gram double patties, topped with cheddar cheese, iceberg, bacon and a very flavorful Smoked BBQ sauce. The burger was pure beauty. The patty was fresh, it wasn't breaking, it was firm, cooked rightfully on the grill and juicy most importantly. The bun was also not soggy and seemed as if baked right this morning. A good burger always satisfies my hungry tummy, and this one was a winner. \n\nI had the chance to also taste the Bistrovia Beef burger \xe2\x80\x93 it was a classic beef burger topped with a ripe piece of tomato and some of their own made sauces. Giant, and juicy. Served with an electric lemonade on the side gives you a refreshing boost with every sip. \n\nThe chicken penne pasta with alfredo sauce was served beautifully. The chicken was grilled and season to perfection. It was tender, juicy and not chewy at all. The sauce was thick, filled with flavor although for me, a little too much parmesan on the top that kind of gets in your way. But overall, nice dish. \n\nAll in all, a great place for a family lunch or dinner. Sweet and kind waiters," delivering you food within 15-20 minutes of serving time. \n\nFor more food fun visit: instagram.com/hamzasfoodventures"""""""

Definitely not me.\n\nThe place was pretty rammed at that time even so we had to wait outside. The manager was polite enough to come outside and asked us if we would want drinks there whilst we were waiting. It was a mint lemonade in blue colour, looked fancy but tasted okay-ish.\n\nAnyways, we were asked to get inside as our order was ready and BOY what we see in front of us was pure gastronomical delight. The burger was bigger than my face and tasted even better.\n\nThe meat was well marinated and had a consistent juicy texture.

Lots of Rangers and security personnels, even guiding you through the venue. \n\n5- keep water bottles handy with you, you'll need it when in long queues or walking inside the venue before actual display starts. The water is scarce or heavily priced at the food stalls. \n\n6- if you're going in day time, carry an umbrella, there are no shades, and this is khi, its very sunny in the day time, ample places to sit though. \n\n7- carry a lot of 100rs note, its easy to transact and help yourself and others behind you to get off from the counters quickly, at best keep cash aside somewhere in pockets to pay and get done quickly. \n\nIm only mentioning the eateries that I tried and liked, the one's that I and friends didn't like are not worth talking about. \n\n1- D'oh nutella churro, the fancy is all worth 250rs \n\n2- Naan Saha s paneer reshmi chicken, quick \nservice, these 300 rs are all worth it, you'll want more \n\n3- Shan Foods served complimentary food throughout the day, there stall was crowded with desi food lovers, nihari, paya, qeema, kaleji, all worth a try, naans are included in an otherwise 100 rs per item, so economical right! \n\n4- Babamoo's loaded potato/ jacket potato good as a snack, too many offerings for a generous topping \n\n5- Teazuro's flavoured tea is something everyone should keep trying after every palette to gulp down the food and clear senses for next one, all flavours smell so good, we tried pineapple, its a sensory exp, rs 100 per cup \n\n6- Meat The Cheese had long lines but enthusiasts! Their Cheesy Chick on a Stick might look expensive for 300rs but totally worth it!

"563	arbor	193	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERHAMZA \n\nEatery: @Locokhi \n\nA fine place that has created its niche in the food industry. Located on the corner of Khe \xe2\x80\x93 Muslim Lane 11", this tapas bar and restaurant is going to create a legacy of its own. A small corner shop, hardly able to accommodate 30 people at max., has had people pouring in and making reservations since the day it opened. And after a long wait, the day finally came when I visited this place. It was a magical experience. They have three timings for reservation \xe2\x80\x93 7pm to 8:30pm, 8:30pm to 10pm and then 10pm onwards. I'll give the ratings below, for those who want a detailed review then read further:\n\nFood taste and quality: 9/10 \nAmbience: 7/10\nLocation: 7.5/10 \nService: 8.5/10 (I kid you not, 15 minutes and all your food is on the table)\nQuantity: 7/10 \nPrice: 7/10\n\nThe dishes that we ordered were the following: Ahi tuna poke and mango salad, Shrimp and cheese croquettes with aioli, stuffed mushroom caps, Japanese inspired snapper ceviche with wasabi, beef tacos, Pizza with Argentinian bresaola and rocket, Limon mojito, and Lomo asado. \n\nAhi tuna poke was a sliced out raw tuna fish served with iceberg, lettuce, mango slices, avocado and dressed in wasabi. I must admit, the wasabi had an amazing hit to it while just taking the first bite. We had to close our eyes and hold our noses because of how strong a hit it had \xe2\x80\x93 one of a kind experience. For salad lovers, this is a must try. \n\nMy favorite starter was the shrimp and cheese croquettes with aioli (mayonnaise seasoned with garlic). A very basic deep-fried croquette that was stuffed with cheese and small pieces of shrimps. Dip them in aioli and you have yourself a kid inside you jumping up and down at how delicious it was. \n\nTo be honest, not the biggest fan of snapper ceviche dressed in wasabi \xe2\x80\x93 but to all those who do love ceviche, my friend says it is the best one he's had here in Karachi. So it is a good option for you if you're looking for some. \n\nThe stuffed mushroom caps were basically tiny pieces of 5 mushrooms stuffed with delicious spinach and cheese that would enter your palate and would burst with flavor! An incredible dish. Very tiny in portion, no doubt, but a dish worth ordering. \n\nThe beef tacos were dry, although had a variety of seasoning served with it and was basically a DIY kind of a deal. Not much of a fan there as well. The pizza on the other hand, wow! Bresaola is air-dried, salted beef that has been aged two or three months until it becomes hard and turns a dark red, almost purple color. A very fine thin crust pizza topped with rocket and bresaola and so much cheese. Oh the cheese. One of the finest recommended dishes at loco is this pizza. \n\nLastly the lomo asado \xe2\x80\x93 sliced tenderloin served with chimichurri and Brazilian vinaigrette. Tenderloin is one of the most expensive meat cuts in the market and they did a very nice medium on it. The perfect texture of a medium done steak that you need, dressed in chimichurri which is made of parsley, garlic, vinegar, olive oil, and flakes of chili pepper and a Brazilian vinaigrette. \n\nAs for the drinks \xe2\x80\x93 their espresso shot is at par with Arbor (meaning extremely good), and the limon mojito and cucumber with jalapeno smoothie is worth trying out. I'll leave you to judge these drinks on your own. Trust my word, so refreshing. \n\nIt was unfortunate that they didn't have churros that day, because I was really looking forward to trying those. But nonetheless, this restaurant is outstanding. It appeals to a certain crowd, with a certain palate, and for those wanting to explore their taste buds \xe2\x80\x93 like myself. It is an expensive place, for four people and those dishes mentioned we were charged roughly around PKR 2100/- per head without ordering dessert. But this place is worth an experience. At least once. Do give it a try on your next dinner outing! And make sure you have a reservation there before you go," or else it'll be hard to find a seat. \n\nWishing loco and its staff the best!"""""""

Another where passes were not being checked-sort of like a cheat gate probably because the management got as frustrated as the crowd. Nevertheless, such events are a blessing. We can either be a spoilsport, suck it up, or present positive constructive feedback so tomorrow could be a better experience.\n\nLet's talk about food. I was inside exactly by 5:20pm. Quite a lot of eateries that I & my sister wanted to try were waiting for their supplies or this or that namely HeyDay, Meat The Cheese, Yey Cheez Sandwhich, Oh My Grill amongst others. Majority were not even ready and prepared and asked us to visit again after an hour. That's quite off-putting when you've skipped your lunch. \n\nDo's( Not in the order of preference)\n\n1)Bombay Chaat House-The pani had the right zing which makes you relish and dip the puri in.\n2) Delhi Biryani-I believe the best I have ever had up till now. Fluffy rice, ample masala, no floating tomatoes and spicy chicken. 140/-\n3)Roasters-Grilled Bacon Beef Cheese Burger. Packed full of flavours and priced at 300/-, it is but a steal. \n4) The Sauce Burger Cafe -Jack Pot in 300/-? WHO CAN RESIST YOU GOTTA TRYYY. Glad to see they have mantained their standard consistently. 300/-\n5) Fam's Patisserie-Nutella waffle with ice cream. No one gets this combo right like they do. 300/-\n6) Pop Bar-STAR OF THE EVENING. They showcased a variety of flavours but then again supplies had run out. Got myself\nraspberry and black berry flavoured. Instant refresher, mood lifter. 140/-\n7)Karamel Cookies. \n\nReally, really wanted to try Shan Biryani as I had missed it last year but it wasnf available. Ended up taking their ready made Nihaari and Paye sample home. Lovely gesture. They were distributing it with naans. \n\nDON'T! JUST STEER CLEAR.\n1) China Kitchen-The chowmein had a burnt texture. It either got overcooked or got piled in the Styrofoam while it was hot (I doubt, I received it warm bordering on cold). Returned it back. Nope, I wasn't refunded. Owner kept claiming that it's just the oyster and sesame oil. Anywho, I wasn't the only one. Saw two more people complaining. \n\n2) Wing It -Loaded fries are LIES. Absolutely terrible! Just don't. Only go for it if you like brown piyaaz, beans and half done fries. 200/- down the drain! \n\n3)Khousay 2.0-This is the first time I have ever tried commercial Khawsay. Can't be a good judge but I think the curry was pretty bland. The chicken wasn't well marinated and overall it just didn't make sense..? 250/- I should've spent elsewhere. \n\n4) Lush Crush-crushed all my dreams. ..\n\nWent thrice at Hey Day and every time I was told that stocks have yet to arrive.

The only thing good about them was the size of their burgers.\nWe went there and ordered 5 Swiss Mushroom Beef burgers (250gm beef patty) along with their combo of fries and drinks with each serving. \nThey served us food after 15 mins but the food was just warm. After they have served us food we got to know that one of our friend don't eat beef so we ordered one Chicken burger (don't exactly remember the name of that coz we just said we need a chicken burger ) any way that burger was served so late that all of us have already eaten our food. Which sort of ruined it coz he wasn't able to eat with us . But again well things happen so move on .  So at the end I went and ask their staff how much for the last chicken burger and ( As we have already paid for our beef burgers) they said sir 950 Rs . I was shocked and asked for the reason and they replied sir it's a double patty. I told them we haven't ordered a double one and their employee said sir we have heard that someone said double patty. All of us denied and I told them since I was the one ordering they should listen to me. Well I did paid for it and left . \nIn short : \n1- The staff was not cooperative and they weren't able to explain the details properly.\n2- The food served wasn't hot like it should be.\n3- The burgers were just So so not that great that we have heard of . \n4- Definitely not going to visit It again coz it was just an over rated place with untrained and uncooperative staff .\n\nTotal damage : 5200 Rs ( Was actually a dent on pocket as my treat was ruined and I felt humiliated)"""""""

579	the deli	199	-	 Had a lovely wintery lunch at THE DELI this friday.\n\nEverything was just perfect'
"580	the deli	199	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERHAMZA\n\nEatery: The Deli\n\nVerdict: For a reasonable price and less confusion", you might get a good deal out of this! \n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nThe Deli has always been one of the trend setters amongst eateries in Karachi for the past 6 years or so. After they newly launched their venue off of E-Street, the newly decorated place offers a lovely ambiance for fine dining experience in the city. Recently, Deli launched a Set Menu Lunch that you can see in the pictures below. It consists of a choice of appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink of your choice hot or cold. And all of that you can get for PKR 1595  + tax per head which to me is amazing! Below are the overall ratings and following that will be the overall experience: \n\nTaste: 7/10 \nQuality: 8.5/10 \nQuantity: 8/10 \nPresentation: 8/10 \nHygiene: 4/5 \nLocation/Ambiance: 8/10 \nValue for money: 8/10 \n\nSo amongst the hors d'oeuvre I ordered: The Classic Beef Carpaccio with rocket leaves, Crusted Chicken Parmigiano Reggiano, and a Creme Brule Cheese Cake with a fresh pomegranate juice. \n\nDisclaimer: The rights of the pictures are mine. The review is only about what I ate but nonetheless, the pictures comprise of the complete menu for better understanding of how everything looks like. If you wish to ask about other dishes, you can comment below since I tasted all of them. \n\nBeef Carpaccio: for those who don't know carpaccio is made with raw meat, thinly sliced and served with vinegar, olive oil, salt and ground pepper and topped with rocket leaves. It's a delicacy, and although raw, has a taste of its own. I'm an absolute beef fanatic and this appetizer took my breath away. \n\nCrusted Chicken Parmigiano Reggiano: Fancy term for Parmesan crusted chicken served with a mushroom and thyme sauce with mashed potatoes at the side. The chicken was cooked right through with a batter only enough to make is crusty and not too overwhelming. The sauce was although runny, but had some great flavor to it. Absolutely loved the mashed potatoes, fluffy, creamy, steamy all what you need in the perfect side. \n\nCreme Brule Cheese Cake: A typical cheesecake fused into being a creme brule served with a blueberry coulee. Because one gets tired of having chocolate filled desserts, this was a kickback from all that sweetness and yet fills your heart and tummy and overcomes all desires for having the perfect ending to the perfect meal. \n\nOne important thing I would like to point out: The Deli has shown its customers around and what I really admire is the fact that their ingredients are bought on a daily basis ergo fresh, and everything they use in their menu is organic. And when you actually have their food, you feel that difference. You know what you're eating is not going to damage you like conveyor belt food does. And I think it's one of the things that truly stand out in this restaurant. \n\nA great place to fine dine in a beautiful ambiance along with polite service," good quantity and great quality food."""""""

We ordered the Chilli Garlic Prawns and both decided to order the Italian Parmesan Chicken. The funny thing is we were asked if we wanted cheese with that at an additional cost of Rs. 550. Why call your steak parmesan chicken steak when there is no cheese with it? The Raclette cheese is nothing to write home about. The serving is not generous at all and to top it off we discovered the place smells horrendous. Not sure if it's because of the cheese but it first smelled like the meat market at Empress and then worsened to how boat basin smells at night while the fish trucks are moving along the road. The mix fruit daiquiri was below average with no real direction. Fresh lime is, of course, fresh lime; cant really go  wrong with that. Coming to the food," the chicken steaks taste like k&ns chicken fillet with breadcrumbs on it. No taste at all. The food was lukewarm and bland. The garlic chilli prawns were basically seven pieces of ultra tiny prawns layered with chilli garlic sauce. I don't get how people can charge such exorbitant prices for such subpar food? I don't see this place lasting very long. And honestly if anyone asks me if they should visit this place I would respond with a resounding NO!

She got me 3 slices as shown in the pic below and we ate two slices right away since i was badly craving for chocolate cake and she loves to eat with me :D \n\nThe cake was heavenly. Trust me with every bite my marginal utility of consumption increased rather than diminishing (highly inspired by this concept i studied in economics in my A levels)\n\nI saved one of the slices to eat it in breakfast. Now comes the twist in my story. I took one bite of the last slice and dhuz dhuz.. i see a big piece of glass in it which if mistakenly eaten could choke or cut my throat. It makes me sad when such big names make such blunders. It was actually a broken glass around 1cm thick and  3cm diameter. \n\nThe point of this post is to alert all of you to please check every bite you eat. \n\nShe got it from Pie in the Sky (Mohammad Ali Society branch). Please be careful when you eat. I am highly disappointed though i believe that human errors do occur but mistakes like these might cause someone their life. \n\nPS: NO FREE CAKES NEEDED'

"659	lal qila	279	-	"" The Swot\'s Guide would like to thank the management of LAL QILA &  Anas Farooqui for inviting the SWOGGERS for dinner.\n\nThis is the brief from all who were there. They will each comment to give more of their personal experiences \n\nIt\'s been 5 years now that I have been going to Lalqila every now and then. It has been good value for money. My favourite there had been their Labeshereen which was always an important reason for me to go. Recently their Labeshereen has turned into a challenge", anyone who finishes it and still keeps smiling should be gifted with a juice or shake, thanks to all the extra flour and lesser cream. This, as I mentioned there too, has been a major downer in their dessert bar. \nOn the good side, their BBQ has undoubtedly changed for the better, be it BBQ Lebanese beef Boti (which otherwise does not settle with Pakistani pallette) or Chicken Boti; masala deeply marinated and softness maintained. However we could have few more items here. \nOverall our experience was pleasant. The food was generally good and I\'d recommend the place to someone looking to have a nice lunch/dinner with family - Hassan Abbas\n\nThis place depicts legendary grandeur of our worth mentioning past and is serving food which is brilliant, to say the least. \nI always preferred going to LalQila when we had limited options like Salt and Pepper Village, for its signature beauties like Shahzada Saleem Khaas and Des Pardes\nIt\'s been three consecutive visits to this place and, to my dismay, I didn\'t get what I wanted to eat. Why on earth would they remove the dishes, they were known for? When I inquired, I was told that it\'s a rotating menu and it\'s just my luck maybe. Right. Maybe. \nBut heyy! I miss eating aforementioned items since they are not available anywhere. They are unique and oh so Yum. All in all, my experience at lalqila is great when it comes to their service, ambiance and food (minus my favorites that I haven\'t had for almost 2 years) - Mehak Shoakat\n\nLal qila is a name I\'m sure a lot of people already are aware of the themed buffet restaurant. This restaurant is a popular choice for both local and foreign visitors with quite an extensive menu consisting of  BBQ and several other diverse dishes. The environment  as well as the food were on point. Mutton yakhni pulao was quite palatable. Biryani wasn\'t extra-ordinary as I was expecting from this place. Tandoori fish was amazingly delicious, BBQ was also succulent and savory. The dessert bar had a lot of items, I tried mango with cream, gulab jamun, mango sheer khurma and all these were a treat to my sweet tooth. Absolutely loved each and every bit of it - Mohammad Saleem\n\nLal Qila is famous for their buffet and at my last visit I managed to try out almost everything their menu had to offer. :D\nSausages with Alfredo sauce was good. The consistency of the sauce was perfect. \nBBQ items were juicy and well spiced. \nMutton Pulao could have been flavoured better and Prawns had that weird seafood smell.\nTheir dessert bar featured a good range; fresh fruits, flavoured yogurt and icecream, different cakes, desi items like lab-e-shereen, and sugar free items. They had original Ice Berg Ice Cream which blew me away as I\'d been craving for it since long. Caramel Pudding was great, too - Tehniat Ali\n\nLal Qila \xe2\x80\x93 the Mughlai theme buffet restaurant. A huge kudos to the Lal Qila management that despite the huge crowd turning in for the dinner buffet, there was almost no delay in preparing and serving hot and fresh food. The variety of cuisine was exceptional, even though we missed their trademark Mughlai cuisine, but as we were told later, it was not part of the menu that day. The highlight of the night was its BBQ and pizza, while a few items including Prawn Tempura and Chinese cuisine were not particularly impressive - Adil R Hussain\n\nThe overall experience was pretty good, many dishes tested well. The desi food however, wasn\'t up to the mark especially the kunna, biryani and pulao. There were less dry items, the desi usuals that is Sajji, behari boti etc were missing as well as the continental ones like lasagna etc. The fish, prawns, batsair and BBQ was too good and the Boulogne\'s pasta and sausages in alfredo sauce were pretty original and tasted well. Overall variety of the main courses was good however it lacked the pointers I mentioned earlier as well as mutton items.\nComing to the deserts, the variety was good but only some of them were the kind you would fell in love with. Moca Java and kulfi were my favorites - Syed Muneeb Hussaini\n\nRecently I visited Lalqila with the SWOT team and the experience was pleasant like all the previous times I have been there. Surprisingly the most delicious of all items for me was smoky umami alfredo pasta. Other classic Lalqila variety like fried batair, prawns, and afghani pulao were delectable but there was a clear difference in the taste of their popular bbq which is usually juicy and flavorsome. On the contrary I found lebanese kebab, and chicken tikka quite dry. As for the dessert section, creamy mangoes were worth binge eating on and so I preferred nibbling on it over other desserts variety. I think the only off point for me was the limited range of mutton variety specially when you compare the range with other buffets like chaupal. But Lalqila\'s tremendous customer service brushed these minor disappointments aside - Hina Ilyas\n\nLal Qila has always been one of my go to places when I want to spend quality time with my family. However, my last visit was dedicated to my TSG family. With a massive variety of delicious food, exceptional BBQ, great friends and such an entertaining customer service, where their royal entertainer dedicated a small humorous verse for each and every one of us, had been an unforgettable experience. The hospitality of the staff and management was quite impressive, much better than my last visit. Hopefully they will continue to maintain that and keep offering their loyal customers nothing but the best - Reza Merchant\n\nMurgh Ranipur is their personal take on paneer handi, and this was hands down the best handi I have downed in a long time.\nThe gravy was perfectly buttered and had copious amounts of cream, and it had the most balanced amount of black pepper, unlike other versions of this.\nChicken Lakhnavi, another Mughlai take on White Karahi and it was delectable, and yet distinctive from the usual karahi\'s I have had.\nTheir combination of yoghurt and cream was so bloody on point," that I had two servings of it with their roghni naan.\nEvery now and then I see posts on this group asking about the best and """"masalay-dar"""" biryani in Karachi"," and usually people answer """"Madni Biryani"""".\nI think Lalqila\'s Shahi Masala Biryani can give the Madni a run for its money. This was the kind of biryani one has at home on a friday or sunday.\nNot the ones where half of the box has elaichi", pieces of tomato or other nasty spices that one doesn\'t want to chew. No this was no bs, vanilla biryani.\nOne should definitely try this - Mohammad Arham\n\nThe BBQ area was top notch. It had variety from Malai Kebab, Chicken Malai Boti and Beef Seekh Kebabs. The queues were made in an orderly fashion and the chefs were pouring the most tender and juiciest BBQ in the plates of guest themselves," which was a delightful sight as everything was being cooked right in front of you and the aroma was overwhelming - Anas Khan'"""

If someone called me and told me that there is a dharna against vegetables at the press club I would drop everything," go there and scream """" GO SABZI GO!!!"""" until I lose my voice. \nMy top picks are the salt and pepper prawns", the chicken Kung pow noodles, chicken gra pow and cumin beef ( this one you will love or hate ). Seriously give it a shot, really good food. \n\nP.s pro tip," remind the operator not to forget the black chili oil. They often do and it\'s a shame because this chili oil is fricken fantastic.'"""

"671	stackers-the burger cafe	296	-	"" Visited Stackers-The Burger Cafe on Saturday. Ordered 2 Escalopes. 1 Dabun Beef"," 2 Pieces Fried Chicken and Garlic Parm fries. Burgers were out of the world specially Escalope ... Patty was juicy and full of taste. Dabun was good too. Garlic Parm fries were also good but cheese was very less. On other hand Fried Chicken pieces were total waste of money. They were too much oily and zero taste. Informed the same to the guy on counter and he reacted positively (very rare gesture). For burgers the place is 10/10. Must visit place for burger lovers.\n\nPS: No pictures because Food was so tempting that we had it all without thinking about taking pictures.'"""

"677	the patio	304	-	"" #TSGBLOGGERHAMZA\n\nEatery: Ambrosia \xe2\x80\x93 Hi Tea (Ambrosia)\n\nVerdict: Great ambiance", fast service but average food taste and quality.\n\nHi teas are on the up and coming these days around Karachi eateries," and every one of the fine dining restaurants is trying to bring the traditional """"English style Hi Tea Experience"""" to you. With the likes of the Patio and the Deli", Ambrosia is also one of those that has brought in a similar style of Hi Tea experience. The menu, albeit, different than the rest but the overall experience was just average. \n\nOverall ratings: \n\nTaste/Quality: 6.5/10\nQuantity: 7/10\nPresentation: 8/10\nService: 7/10\nAmbiance: 8/10\nLocation: 8/10\nPer head: 895 + tax\n\nThe platter served, serves two people and the timings for Hi Tea are 4-7pm.\n\nSavories: \n\nTurkey Sandwich \xe2\x80\x93 a multi-grain bread sandwich (single sandwich) cut in half with mayo, iceberg and a piece of frozen off the shelf thin turkey piece. Disappointing. \n\nSmoked Salmon Canape \xe2\x80\x93 a similar multi-grain bread piece sliced in half with, if you looked closely, you\'ll find a small piece of smoked salmon on top with a little spread of mayonnaise. Why even?\n\nTomato and Olive bruschetta \xe2\x80\x93 this was done like it was supposed to be done. Perfect. A nice piece of garlic bread, grilled, topped with salt and generous dressings of tomato and olives. But I had a hard time wrapping my head around why I should have this during tea time? Not something I believe would appeal to general public. \n\nQuiche Lorraine \xe2\x80\x93 the quiche lorraine was exactly what it was supposed to be. A small open crust pastry, savory, filled with egg, cheese and meat. This was rather nice, although inconsistency prevailed in most regarding the amount of egg present. Some of them had an overwhelming amount of egg which made it rather unpleasant to have. \n\nChicken and Mushroom vol au vent \xe2\x80\x93 a nice one bite puff pastry topped with chicken pieces and mushrooms, dressed in mushroom sauce. A delicate and wonderful piece of hi tea savory. \n\nMini Beef Burger \xe2\x80\x93 probably the best thing on the menu. Excellent patty, a soft bun and good enough to go along with the menu. \n\nDesserts: \n\nDark Chocolate Tart \xe2\x80\x93 a very well done dark chocolate, made with consistency and a nice crust at the bottom. \n\nBerry Muffin \xe2\x80\x93 I didn\'t try this, so I\'ll leave this open for comments if you have tried it. \n\nDrinks: \n\nYou get served with either tea/coffee/green tea and an Iced tea \xe2\x80\x93 all your choices. Very standard coffee, nothing too special. \n\nThe presentation was up to the mark, the place was clean, hygienic. The servers there were polite and they had a relatively faster service than most. The restaurant in its own is pleasant place to be if you\'re going there for fine dining. Nicely lit, a very fancy d\xc3\xa9cor and great ambiance. Fall in love with the restaurant once you walk in.\n\nSuggestions: May be change your menu a bit. If you\'re trying to bring in the English Hi Tea experience, might I suggest you try scones as well. Have a separate menu for each week and most importantly, focus on the taste of what you serve. The sandwiches and canape can be brought up a notch. \n\nP.S: I know some pictures might be blurry," I\'m still learning - bear with me. Thanks.'"""
"678	the patio	304	-	"" The first time I tried The Patio Hi-tea", I was hooked and it instantly became one of my favorite places to be at until ..\n\nAnother day, another dawn. Me and a friend had an early lunch date set. We got there at like 01:30ish and were served with their freshly baked bread basket, upon our arrival.\n\nThe bread basket arrived first with herb butter and dipping . A dinner roll, a muffin, with 2 pieces of bread. It was fresh and very well toasted.\n\nWe went through the menu and decided to order the Arabic mezze platter," Mulligatawny soup and Olive Tapenede roll of """"some king"""" as our appetizers.\n\nThe mezze appears to be in an extended platter with three spreads", hummus, baba ganoush and labeh topped with feta and served with pita and lavash crackers.\n\nThe mulligatawny was a hearty chicken soup, rich with lentils," vegetables and rice.\nLastly the olive tapenede roll of """"some l king"""" was an absolute disappointment.\nAs soon as we were done destroying our appetizers", our mains were immediately served.\n\nMy boyfriend happened to have ordered the pepper beef fillet. It was a Roasted fillet of beef with freshly crushed peppercorn & cream sauce. Served with whipped mash potato. Perfectly cooked. \n\nI on the other hand, had ask for chicken roulade to be served as my main. Roulade of lean chicken breast pan-roasted, stuffed with mozzarella, spinach & olives which was served with a herb infused cream sauce and FRENCH FRIES as my side.\n\nFollowed by the Malt Kulfi and Tres Leches Cake that we ordered for our dessert.\n\nFinal Verdict: everything was quite standard other than olive tapenede roll, chicken roulade and the tres leches cake which were an absolute disappointment.\n\nThe olive tapenede rolls were quite a bit off. We had to leave it after the first few bites.\nComing down to my chicken roulade. I was legitimately expecting it to come up to Deli\'s chicken swiss polo (atleast). Sadly," it felt like Shan\'s tandoori masala had been quite in use.\nTres leches cake. I don\'t even know if it\'s appropriate to say this. It was too """"wet""""??!? I get the idea of this cake being moist but not too watery that it starts dripping all over my face. Forget comparing it to Auntie Munaver\'s Food & Dessert"," I\'ve had better tres leeches cake at lowkey food joints.'"""

"680	pizza bite	308	-	"" Highly Disappointed with the Pizza delivery service and taste of Pizza Bite.. Worst ever experience....  starting with the placement of delivery: we placed the order on call at around 9:45 pm and the guy promised to deliver within 45 min...but it was not until 11:16", we received our long-awaited pizza... The pizza was too much smelly (the cheese might have expired or was of low quality) ... Topping was pathetic... The taste of pizza was like a naan... The bread quality was very poor... In addition, the chicken wings (being part of the deal) were over cooked and oil was just dropping from these wings... \nIn a nutshell, it was worst experience ever," never gonna order anything from Pizza Bite again and never gonna recommend anybody to have worst pizza...'"""

"682	pizza bite	308	-	"" As always Foodpanda Pk didn't miss a chance to let us down and do some petty fraud. I paid online for some food from pizza bite through food panda and left the office. Told the staff that its been paid online. When the rider came staff couldn't get through to me and restaurant insisted payment hadn't been done online. Thus they ended up taking cash payment. All we can do is pray that some other better food delivery comes up. We paid double. Even complained to the restaurant and they didnt seem to want to do anything about. Made an excuse its the night shifts fault so we cant do anything. Maybe its time Imran Khan needs to do a dharna to expose the corruption of foodpanda.\n\nUPDATE: I wanted to thank foodpanda and pizza bite for the amazing resilience and speed with which they actively worked to have my complaint removed from social media. After they ignored my complains in the morning I was compelled to post my complains on social media. Within minutes I got a call and a rider was sent to return the money. The rider had come with a mission. Get the complain taken down. He kept insisting that he was being so nice and returning the money though was unwilling to do so till the complain was taken down. After 15 minutes of arguing he finally agreed to return the money without me taking down the complain. Oh and the best part he was insisting they made a mistake cause it was the weekend and there was rush. Don't know how Tuesday is a weekend. Finally I thought it was all done and dusted but while I was lying in bed. Finally able to sleep after all the stress they had given me. Around midnight I started getting calls from pizza bite yet again harassing me to take down the complain. I still do not understand how foodpanda does not take action against restaurants that harass customers like this. If foodpanda claims its not their fault and the restaurants then such restaurants should be removed. Because I ordered through foodpanda and unless they take some serious serious action against the restraunt I am holding them responsible for being party to this harassment."""""""
